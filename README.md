Potential rough read me idea (we can finalize it once our decisions for the web app is official)

As an individual interested in healthy eating with a busy lifestyle,

I want an app that generates recipes that are convenient to make with what is available in the fridge while still having a balanced meal.

So that I can reduce food waste, while avoiding unhealthy fast food chains and acquiring all essential nutrients for my body.
